"""Configuration constants used across the training and model modules.

This module centralizes filesystem and checkpoint filename constants so
other modules can import a single stable source of truth for file
locations and conventional filenames used by the training and model
serialization code.

Notes
-----
These are plain string constants and are intended to be imported as
required, for example::

        from config import RESULTS_DIR, G_FILE

Do not put runtime logic in this module; it only contains constants.
