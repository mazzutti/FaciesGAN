To ensure full parity between the C and Python (MLX) training loops, you should:

Match all random seeds and initialization routines (weights, data shuffling, etc.).
Ensure both versions use the same data preprocessing and batching logic.
Verify that all hyperparameters (learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc.) are identical.
Confirm that the model architectures and layer implementations are mathematically equivalent.
Check for differences in numerical precision (float32 vs float64, etc.).
Compare loss calculations and backpropagation steps for consistency.
Log intermediate values (weights, gradients, losses) at each step in both versions and compare them.
Use the same order of operations and avoid any nondeterministic behavior (e.g., parallelism, threading).
If possible, write unit tests that run both versions on the same small batch and compare outputs step by step.
